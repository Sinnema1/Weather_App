## Description

This application is intended to provide weather data from `openweathermap.org` through the use of APIs. The weather will be presented for the current day and 5 day forecast. There will also be a history for cities searched that can be called back on to get the weather again. Below is an example of what the page looks like. You can find a direct link to the application in the Questions section below

## Installation

To install this project, you can clone it from the GitHub repository linked in the "Questions" section below.

## Usage

To use this project, you can either clone it to your own repository or create a branch and submit a pull request when you're done with the changes you'd like to make. The application uses APIs to fetch the data and is dependent on proper communication between the sever and client side to render all data as expected.

## License

This application is covered under the MIT license.

## Contributing

Anyone may contribute to this project, there are no restrictions.

## Tests

After cloning, you can make sure that the application is working first by running `npm install` to get all necessary packages. Next, check the package.json to learn more about the npm run commands. For this project, you can run it in development mode using `npm run start:dev` or you can build and run the project using `npm run start`. Once you've accessed your application in the browser with the correct local host port (something like http://localhost:3001/), you can enter a city in the search bar of the application. You should see weather data appear for current weather and forecast as well as creating a search history artifact below the search bar. Assuming the data is all correct, this tests that the application is working as designed.
